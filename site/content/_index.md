    heading: My Background
    text: With a track record of exceptional customer service and over three years of experience on front-end projects, I know what it takes to fulfill customer needs.  
During my time at Oregon State University, I worked closely with professors to design their authored books for the web, ensuring their visions came to life.  I oversaw the production and completion of 10 web-based books.  
At UC San Diego, I have worked with administrative faculty to create user-friendly reports that often exceeded expectations.  I was awarded the Staff Appreciation and Recognition Award for “exceptional customer service, proactively streamlining processes, and innovating solutions to improve customer experience.”  
I take pride in ensuring customers’ needs are heard and met.

    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
